# Sample GitHub Markdown with LaTeX Equations

This document contains some mathematical equations written using LaTeX syntax. Below are a few examples of different types of equations.

## 1. Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is used to find the roots of a quadratic equation:

\[
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
\]

The solution is given by the following formula:

\[
\tag{1} x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

## 2. Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean Theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle:

\[
\tag{2} a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]

Where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the legs of the triangle,
- \( c \) is the length of the hypotenuse.

## 3. Euler's Formula

Euler's formula is a fundamental equation in complex analysis:

\[
\tag{3} e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
\]

Where:
- \( e \) is the base of the natural logarithm,
- \( i \) is the imaginary unit,
- \( \cos(x) \) and \( \sin(x) \) are the trigonometric functions.

## 4. Area of a Circle

The area \( A \) of a circle is calculated using the radius \( r \) and the constant \( \pi \):

\[
\tag{4} A = \pi r^2
\]

## 5. Summation Notation

Summation notation is used to sum a sequence of numbers:

\[
\tag{5} S = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

This equation represents the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

## 6. Lagrangian in Physics

The Lagrangian \( L \) in classical mechanics is given by the difference between kinetic energy \( T \) and potential energy \( V \):

\[
\tag{6} L = T - V
\]
